(CE)                                                                                   
                                                                                       
Survey Description:                                                                    
The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program provides estimates of employment,      
hours, and earnings information on a national basis and in considerable industry       
detail.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects payroll data each month from a sample 
of business and government establishments in all nonfarm activities.                   
                                                                                       
Employment data include series for total employment, number of women employees, and    
number of production or nonsupervisory employees. Estimates of average hourly          
earnings, average weekly hours, average weekly earnings, and average weekly overtime   
hours are produced for both all employees and for production or nonsupervisory         
employees. Overtime hours are produced for manufacturing industries only.              
                                                                                       
A sample of approximately 121,000 businesses and government agencies representing      
approximately 631,000 worksites throughout the United States is utilized for this      
monthly survey. The sample contains about 324,000 employer units.                      
                                                                                       
All employment, hours and earnings series are classified according to the 2022 North   
American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The industry code used in the survey 
corresponds to the NAICS code, except in those cases where multiple industries have    
been combined.                                                                         
                                                                                       
Summary of Data Available:                                                             
For all employees, women employees, and production or nonsupervisory employees, CES    
publishes about 3,800 monthly series. The series for all employees cover about
900 industries on both a seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted basis.        
                                                                                       
Approximately 2,100 series for AHE, AWH, and, in manufacturing, AWOH for both all 
employee and production and nonsupervisory employees are published monthly on a not 
seasonally adjusted basis and cover approximately 500 industries.

Over 3,900 seasonally adjusted employment, hours, and earnings series for AE, PE, and 
WE are published. About 7,100 derivative series such as average weekly earnings (AWE), 
indexes, and constant-dollar series for AE and PE are also published for about
500 industries.
                                  
Most employment series begin in 1990, although some series, including industry         
supersectors, are available from 1939. Supersectors include: mining and logging;       
construction; manufacturing; trade, transportation, and utilities; information;        
financial activities; professional and business services; private education and health         
services; leisure and hospitality; other services; and government.                     
                                                                                       
Frequency of Observations:                                                             
Data series are monthly in most cases; quarterly averages are available for total      
employment, average weekly hours, and average overtime hours, seasonally adjusted      
(datatypes 19, 20, 25, 36, and 37).                                                    
                                                                                       
Annual averages are available for all series that are not adjusted for seasonality     
(except for the 12-month diffusion index series).                                      
                                                                                       
Data Characteristics:                                                                  
Earnings are measured in dollars and are published to the nearest cent (two decimal    
places). Average weekly and overtime hours are measured in hours and are published to 
the nearest tenth of an hour (one decimal place).                                      
                                                                                       
Employment is measured in thousands of workers and is stored with no decimal place for 
all supersectors and for both durable goods and nondurable goods in manufacturing.     
Employment for all other industries are stored to one decimal place.                   
                                                                                       
Special characteristics of the data are footnoted where necessary. For example; I      
indicates that the seasonally adjusted series is independently seasonally adjusted and 
not used in aggregating to higher summary industries. For all employees, higher        
summary series, such as total nonfarm, are aggregated up from the 3-digit NAICS level. 
                                                                                       
Release Schedule: https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/news-release-schedule.htm                                 
Releases are usually available on the third Friday following the week containing the   
12th of the reference month (the reference period is the pay period that includes the  
12th of the month). Each release contains first preliminary estimates for the          
reference month, second preliminary estimates for the month preceding the reference    
month, and third final estimates for the month two months prior to the reference       
month.                                                                                 
                                                                                       
Each year with the release of January estimates in February, CES data are re-anchored  
to universe counts of nonfarm employment or benchmarks for the most recent March. For  
example, CES introduced March 2024 benchmark counts with the release of January 2025   
first preliminary estimates in February 2025. On a not seasonally adjusted basis, all  
series are subject to revision back to the prior year’s benchmarked data (21 months of 
data), while 5 years of seasonally adjusted estimates are subject to revision 
(or more if required due to a series reconstruction).

Text files listed in the survey directory                                              
                                                                                       
Text files allow data users to retrieve large amounts of data with one selection.      
These datasets are highly suited for statistical software that manipulate large        
datasets. The files are arranged first on a broad industry base, followed by industry 
specific groups. In addition to data files, a series of mapping files are also         
available and provide a means for identifying all variables in the data files. This   
section identifies and describes the multi-series text files available for download    
from the LABSTAT database at https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/ce/.             
                                                                                       
These four files contain data for most or all supersectors combined.               
                                                                                       
   *ce.data.0.ALLCESSeries - contains the entire history of all series                
             currently published by the CES program. With the release of November 2024 
             data on December 6, 2024, new series reflecting the monthly collection rates
             for the first preliminary, second preliminary, and third release of data for 
             total nonfarm, as well as monthly response rates (at third release of data) 
             for total private, have been included in this file. These series are identified 
             as CEU00000000C1, CEU00000000C2, CEU00000000C3, and CEU05000000RR. 
             These 4 additional series represent the only series changes to this file from 
             the previous published version.

   *ce.data.03c.AllRealEarningsPE - contains the complete history of real              
             earnings of production or nonsupervisory employees for every              
             industry for which CES also publishes current dollar earnings             
             series. The series in this file include:                                  
         *   Average Weekly Earnings of Production Employees, $82-84 (31)              
         *   Average Hourly Earnings of Production Employees, $82-84 (32) 

The ce.data.Goog file contains the following datatypes, if applicable, for all supersectors
listed in the ce.supersector mapping file: 
         *   All employees
	 *   Average weekly hours of all employees
	 *   Average hourly earnings of all employees
	 *   Average weekly earnings of all employees
             
                                                                                       
The remaining CES text files are categorized first by Supersector, then by groups of   
datatypes.

Time series, series file, data file, & mapping file definitions and relationships      
                                                                                       
A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time         
for a consistent time interval (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).     
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data    
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price      
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment    
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.                                                   
                                                                                       
The text files are organized to provide data users with the necessary information to   
interpret data files:                                                                  
                                                                                       
a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)                                    
b)  mapping files                                                                      
c)  data files                                                                         
                                                                                       
The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series              
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.             
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:    
                                                                                       
a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation                     
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation.              
                                                                                       
The mapping files, or definition files, contain explanatory text descriptions          
that correspond to various codes contained within each series identification code.     
                                                                                       
The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a    
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:                
                                                                                       
a) a series identification code                                                        
b) year in which data is observed                                                      
c) period for which data is observed (M13 indicates annual averages)                   
d) value                                                                               
e) footnote code (if necessary)

The first line of the ce.series files shows several fields or data elements separated  
by tabs. Each of the remaining lines in ce.series represents one unique CES series.    
Note that the field numbers are for reference only and do not exist in the LABSTAT     
database. Data files are in ASCII text format.  Each data element is                   
listed below and shows the length of the data element field followed by a value        
(example). Each series record ends with a new line character.

Data file format and field definitions 

The first line of each data file shows several fields or data elements separated   
by tabs. Each of the remaining lines in the data file represents one unique CES series 
and data point and is divided into fields or data elements. Note that the field        
numbers are for reference only and do not exist in the LABSTAT database. Data files    
are in ASCII text format. Each data element is listed below and shows the name of the  
element, the length of the data element field, and a value example.  Each data record  
ends with a new line character.                                                        
                                                                                       
The ce.data file is partitioned into a number of separate files:  See Section 2        
                                                                                       
The above-referenced data files have the following format:
